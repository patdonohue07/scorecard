# Scorecard

Pairs trading signal dashboard tracking three equity pairs — BAC/JPM, V/MA, and PEP/KO.

Each morning, the script calculates the beta-adjusted overnight gap shock for each pair, ranks it against a historical distribution, and fires a trade signal when the percentile hits the threshold. Entry at open, exit at close, dollar neutral.

## Strategy

For each pair, the shock is calculated as:

shock = lead_gap - beta × target_gap

where gap = (open / prev_close) - 1

The shock is ranked against a pre-built historical distribution. A signal fires when the percentile exceeds the upper threshold (short lead, long target) or falls below the lower threshold (long lead, short target).

## Pairs

| Pair | Beta | Threshold |
|------|------|-----------|
| BAC / JPM | 0.799 | 75 / 25 |
| V / MA | 0.648 | 75 / 25 |
| PEP / KO | 0.536 | 85 / 15 |
